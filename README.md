# Exam Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the python code and documentation for analyzing the "Exam" dataset using
 Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to study hours, previous exam score and pass/fail.
Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.

## Dataset Description
The "Exam" dataset contains information about students passed or failed the exam. Each entry represents a unique 
dining experience and includes the following columns:

- **Study Hours**: Represents the number of hours an individual has studied for an exam.
- **Previous Exam Score**: Denotes the score achieved by an individual in a previous exam, possibly related to the current one.
- **Pass/Fail**: Indicates whether an individual passed or failed the exam based on their performance.
